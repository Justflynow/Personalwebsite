I am a senior undergrad major in mathematics and applied mathematics at Wuhan University. In the past, I mainly studied pure mathematics and had the background of differential equations and functional analysis, but now I am broadly interested in functional analysis application in statistics, statistical analysis of kinematic data and functional data analysis basic theory, especially principal differential analysis. Recently, I have been particularly excited about statistical analysis method of human motion control process.
